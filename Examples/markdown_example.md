# This is a Markdown file

Markdown is an easy way for formatting text on the web. Markdown can be in a file such as this one (with a .md extension) or it can be used in a Markdown cell in Jupyter. The formatted text is actually displayed as HTML so you can think of Markdown as being a short-hand for typing actual html tags (which normally look like this `<h1>This is a Markdown file</h1>`).

When viewing a markdown file in Jupyter, you can right-click the file in the file browser (to the left), select `Open With...`, and choose either Editor or Markdown Preview.

Try opening this file in Editor and then open it again in a new tab and open with Markdown Preview.

Click the Editor tab and drag to the left side of this content window and then drag the Markdown Preview tab to the right. This way you can see both windows at once.

Now, add some new markdown (text) of your own. You will see it automatically updated in the Markdown Preview.

Markdown is also commonly used in various text input boxes around the internet such as at [stackoverflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com) and at [GitHub](http://www.github.com)
